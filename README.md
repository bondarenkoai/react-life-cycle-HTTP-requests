5. All expected props are passed to each component during invocation.
6. Component names are descriptive and understandable.
7. JavaScript code is clean and understandable, using Prettier.

### ✅ Phonebook:

Take your solution from the previous homework assignment and add storage of phonebook contacts to localStorage. Use lifecycle methods.

-   Step 1:  
    Contacts are stored in local storage when adding and removing contacts.

-   Step 2:  
    Upon application load, contacts, if any, are read from local storage and stored in the state.

### ✅ Image Search:

    Write an application for searching images by keyword.

-   Step 1:  
    Create components `<Searchbar>`, `<ImageGallery>`, `<ImageGalleryItem>`, `<Loader>`, `<Button>`, and `<Modal>`. Ready-made styles for the components can be found in the `styles.css` file and adjusted as needed.
